# mini-projects-python-basics
Topic-wise Python mini projects to practice and reinforce fundamental concepts like data structures, functions, OOP, file handling, and more.

# 🐍🧪 Mini Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of Python mini projects — a curated set of topic-wise explorations that document my learning journey in data science, machine learning, and AI fundamentals.

## 📌 Why this repository?

This space is like my personal learning playground where I try out concepts in smaller, bite-sized formats. These projects help me:
- Reinforce core concepts
- Experiment with datasets
- Understand how to structure and debug code
- Build confidence before diving into bigger real-world problems

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an evolving repository and will be updated regularly as I continue to explore new concepts and solidify my Python foundation. It includes projects ranging from beginner to intermediate level, and will gradually expand to cover advanced patterns too.
